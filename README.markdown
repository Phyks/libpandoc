# Status

As of Thu Oct 15, the goal for the week is supporting a streaming
interface and all Pandoc flags. This works already from C. Currently
updating the C#/.NET client. The Scheme client is to be updated later.

# Help wanted

  * feedback on the exposed C interface  
  * bindings to Ruby, Python, PHP, your favorite language
  * favorite language packaging for OSes (later)
