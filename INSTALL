% `libpandoc` Installation

This note contains build and installation instructions for the
`libpandoc` shared library.  See `README.markdown` for more
information.


# Building

Building follows standard Haskell conventions and requires the
[Haskell Platform][haskell-platform]:

    # runhaskell Setup.lhs configure [--user]
    # runhaskell Setup.lhs build    
 
The configure stage may report missing dependencies.  These can be
obtained as follows:

    # cabal install [dependency]

A successful build creates the shared library file in
`./dist/build/libpandoc.dll/libpandoc.dll`.  Installation and use of
the library is platform-dependent.

# UNIX Installation

For your convenience, an `./install.sh` is provided that installs the
shared object and header files under `/usr/local`.  It has been tested
on Ubuntu Linux.

To install system-wide in the `$LIB` folder, copy `libpandoc.dll` to
`$LIB/libpandoc.so` and run `ldconfig $LIB`.  Also, copy
`src/pandoc.h` to `$INCLUDES/`.
 
To use the library from C, do:

    #include <pandoc.h>
    pandoc(...)

And compile as:

    gcc -lpandoc [my-file.c]


# Windows Installation
 
For your convenience, an `./install.bat` is provided that installs the
shared library under `%windir%\System32`.

Deploy the shared library in the same folder as your application, or
put it under `%PATH%`.  Intallation of header files depends on the C
compiler.
