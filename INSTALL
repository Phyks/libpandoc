Building libpandoc on Ubuntu
----------------------------

First install some packages. YMMV - I probably already had a couple of
needed dependencies installed, such as `build-essentials`.

    sudo apt-get install ghc6 haskell-devscripts libghc6-network-dev \
        libghc6-parsec-dev libghc6-mtl-dev

Go to http://haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-latest/ and grab
the latest.

    tar xfz cabal-install-X.X.X.tar.gz
    cd cabal-install-X.X.X
    ./bootstrap.sh

Grab a cup of coffee.

When it's done, you just need to link the `cabal` binary.

    cd
    mkdir -p bin
    cd bin
    ln -s ~/.cabal/bin/cabal cabal

Alternatively, add ~/.cabal/bin to your path.

Use cabal to install the required packages:

    cabal update
    cabal install json
    cabal install pandoc

To enable extra features of Pandoc:

    cabal install pandoc -fhighlighting -fciteproc

And finally, we can build the binary:

    cd /path/to/libpandoc
    make
